PassengerReadMe
    - Choose a ride page: the pull out is still too low
    - Update photo option for profile
    - Obviously, the chat feature
    - Add a verified checkmark if the email was verified (which it should be upon signup)
    - Change icons and colors maybe


As I'm going: 
    - confirm-ride "Request Ride" button is all the way at the bottom of the page
    - from current location wont' include my address? i have to manually type it in right now
