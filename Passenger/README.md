As I'm going: 
- ETA of driver is currently a random number
- Alert for drivers for new ride shows a rideTime estimate, it's a random number I think
- eta once the ride has started on the passenger screen needs to be fixed to match actual google maps data
- tip is showing up in the Connect account of the driver, but the fare share isn't
- make admin page to change pricing of rides
