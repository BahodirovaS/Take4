As I'm going: 
- ETA of driver is currently a random number
- Alert for drivers for new ride shows rideTime estimate, it's a random number I think
- eta once the ride has started on the passenger screen needs to be fixed
- tip is showing up in the Connect account of the driver, but the fare share isn't
- look up how to do this: Also enable Google sign-in in Firebase Auth and add your Vercel domain to Authorized domains in the Firebase console.
